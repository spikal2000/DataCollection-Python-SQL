#Weekly Data Collection and Warehousing with Python, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL

This project is designed to collect data using a Python script and store it in a MySQL database. The data is then moved to a data warehouse built using Microsoft SQL, with the help of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) at the end of every week.
Project Description

In this project, we have developed a system that automates the process of collecting and storing data, and then moving it to a data warehouse on a weekly basis. This is achieved by utilizing Python for data collection, MySQL for initial data storage, and Microsoft SQL for the data warehouse. SSIS is used to simplify and streamline the process of transferring data between the two databases.
Key Features:

    Data collection using a Python script
    Storing collected data in a MySQL database
    Creating a data warehouse using Microsoft SQL
    Weekly data transfer to the data warehouse with SSIS
